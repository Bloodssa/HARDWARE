                    Why Build your Own PC?
                </div>
                <div class="des1">
                    One of the main reasons people opt to build their own PC is the ability to fully customize and personalize it to meet 
                    their specific needs, requirements, and style. The way you plan to use your PC will dictate the 
                    amount of storage and memory you need, as well as the desired speed. For instance, a gamer would prioritize 
                    a high-performance graphics processing unit 
                    (GPU) for superior visuals, while a business PC might focus on having ample storage capacity to accommodate files, images, and data. <br><br>

                    There is a sense of achievement and satisfaction in building your own PC. Seeing the hard work you put into the build and then being 
                    able to use it brings a new sense of accomplishment.
                     Building your own computer is the perfect way to better understand how PCs work and to improve your technical skills and knowledge.

                <div class="text" id="cost">
                    How much does it cost to build a PC?
                </div>
                <div class="des1">
                    The amount of money you spend on building a PC can vary greatly, depending on what components you need, so it’s a good idea to have a realistic budget in mind ahead of time. 
                    <br><br>
                    Since memory and storage take up a large chunk of the cost of a new computer, building your own PC gives you the flexibility to save on these components if you wish. While RAM and SSD costs rise with the amount of capacity they offer, they can be less expensive than buying pre-installed components that are often inadequate and need to be upgraded quickly.

                <div class="des1">
                    Building a PC typically takes around 3 to 4 hours for beginners and 1 to 2 hours for experienced builders, once you have all the parts. This includes preparation, assembly, and following guides, but additional time may be needed for troubleshooting and installing the operating system.  Make sure you set aside enough time to properly build your PC.  <br><br>

                    If you need to take a break while building your PC, it’s generally safe to leave the components on the table, but keep small parts organized and cover sensitive components to protect them from dust and static.

                    Step-by-step guide on how to build a PC
                </div>
                <div class="des1">
                    Once you have researched and purchased all your components, you are now ready to put them all together and build your PC. This is where it really starts to get exciting, and it all comes together. The order can vary slightly depending on your case, but this is a general order we recommend.  <br><br>

                    It is important to note that when installing each component, they should click as they slot in. If you do not hear a click, do not force it in and instead take the component out and gently try again. 
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    Step 1: Prepare a PC case
                </div>
                <div class="des1">
                    The first step is to prepare the PC case before installing all the other components inside. You will need to remove the side panels and set them aside, with the screws, safely as you will need to add them back at the end of the build. <br><br>

                    For the next few steps, we will be working outside of the case before installing all the components inside. 
                </div><div class="step">
                    Step 2: Install the CPU
                </div>

                
                <div class="des1">
                    The CPU needs to be installed into the motherboard. So, the first step is to find the CPU socket which should be covered by a protective plastic case. Next to the case you’ll see a small metal lever, press down on this gently to open the socket tray. <br><br>

                    Next, take the CPU extremely carefully by only holding the edges. Do not touch the pins or the top of the chip as this can imprint them with dust or oils from your fingers and cause damage.  <br><br>

                    On the motherboard socket, you will see a small arrow, this arrow needs to line up with the arrow in one of the corners of the CPU. Gently place the CPU in the motherboard, with the arrows lining up, and lower the lever back down; the lever may require some force. <br><br>

                    If you are using an M.2 SSD this will need to be installed directly into the motherboard’s M.2 slot, located next to the CPU, and should be done after installing the CPU chip. 
                </div>
                
                
                <div class="step">
                    Step 3: Install the CPU cooling system
                </div>
                <div class="des1">
                    The CPU cooler also needs to be installed onto the motherboard. Before installing you will need to check if the cooler requires a mounting bracket. If it does not need one you may need to remove the pre-installed bracket in your motherboard, if it has one.  <br><br>

                    Refer to the installation instructions that came with the CPU cooler but generally, they are installed around the CPU socket that you just installed in the motherboard. If your CPU cooler does not come with a pre-applied thermal paste, you will need to manually apply a small, pea-sized dot to the middle of the CPU. The pressure when installing the cooler will spread the thermal paste.  
                </div>
                
                
                
                
                <div class="step">
                    Step 4: Install the memory (RAM)
                </div>
                <div class="des1">
                    RAM is one of the most straightforward components to install when building a PC. Firstly, locate the memory slots on the motherboard and determine how many, if all, will be filled; this will depend on how much memory your PC will hold and can be upgraded in the future. If you are not using all the RAM slots, check the instructions to find the correct configuration. Hold the memory modules on the side and avoid touching the chips and gold pins. Align the notches on the module with the ridge in the slot and press down firmly until it clicks into place. For more details on installing RAM, read our guides on how to install memory on a laptop or on a desktop. 
                </div>
                
                
                
                <div class="step">
                    Step 5: Connect the power supply unit
                </div>
                <div class="des1">
                    We are now ready to start installing components into the PC case, starting with unpacking the PSU and setting the cables aside. Identify where the PSU goes in the PC case; this is usually on the bottom near the back of the case. Place the PSU in the case with the fan facing outside. If your PC case has ventilation holes and a dust filter on the bottom we recommend installing the PSU upside down for better airflow. <br><br>

                    Attach the PSU with the four screws it came with, being careful not to overtighten. If you are using a non-modular or semi-modular power supply, run the attached cables through the case.  
                </div>
                
                
                
                
                <div class="step">
                    Step 6: Install the motherboard
                </div>
                <div class="des1">
                    Before installing the motherboard you need to install the IO plate and the motherboard standoffs to the back of the PC case if they aren’t already pre-installed. Keep the cables behind the motherboard tray to keep it tidy and clean. <br><br>

                    Fasten the motherboard down starting with the middle screw and then install each screw diagonally from the other. Be careful to not apply too much force as the board should be secure but not over-tightened.  <br><br>

                    Connect the power supply to the motherboard by attaching the 8-pin CPU connector to the top of the motherboard and the 24-pin connector to the side.  
                </div>
                
                
                
                <div class="step">
                    Step 7: Install the graphics processing unit (GPU)
                </div>
                <div class="des1">
                    If you have chosen to install a GPU, first find the PCIe x16 slot on the motherboard; this will be the longest slot and could be a different color. If there are two x16 slots refer to the user manual to see which slot should be used. Secure the GPU to the back of the PC case using two screws.  
                </div>
                
                
                
                <div class="step">
                    Step 8: Install the storage (SSD)
                </div>
                <div class="des1">
                    Within your PC case, you will see a stack of bays in different sizes, this is where the SSD goes. Typically there are two storage sizes, 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch. The 3.5-inch bays can usually hold both sizes but the 2.5-inch bay can only hold that size.  <br><br>

                    Each bay has its own lever or switch to open the tray which you can then place the drive into. If you place a 2.5-inch drive into a 3.5-inch tray you will need to screw it in so it doesn’t move around. The type of installation can differ depending on the SSD you've purchased (2.5-inch, mSATA, or M.2) so be sure to check the owner's manual and refer to our how to install a Crucial SSD. <br><br>

                    Once all your SSD drives are in place, connect them to the motherboard, using a SATA cable, and to the power supply. 
                </div>
                
                
                <div class="step">
                    Step 9: Connect the accessories
                </div>
                <div class="des1">
                    Double-check that all internal components are securely connected. Once confirmed, reattach the side panel of your PC case. Now, it’s time to assemble the rest of your setup. Start by placing your monitor on a stable surface and connecting it to your PC using the appropriate cable, such as HDMI, DisplayPort, or VGA. Plug the monitor’s power cable into an outlet. <br><br>

                    Next, connect the keyboard and mouse by plugging them into the USB ports on your PC. Ensure all cables are securely connected before plugging the PC’s power cable into an outlet. Press the power button on the PC case to power up your system. <br><br>  

                    Your PC should start up, and you will need to follow the on-screen instructions to install the Operating System (OS) of your choice. By following these steps, your PC should be ready for use. Enjoy your new setup! 
                </div>
                
                
                
                <div class="step">
                    Step 10: Installing the operating system
                </div>
                <div class="des1">
                    The final step is to install your chosen Operating System (OS). Having the installer already prepared on a drive will make it easier and quicker to install on your new PC. Follow the instructions provided for your specific OS for a smooth installation. ​​<br><br>

                    Once you turn on your PC you will be asked to open BIOS. Here you will want to find where it shows all your PC system information to confirm all the components are being recognized. Then locate the Boot page and select the drive and the internal SSD drive you want to install the OS on. ​​​  <br><br>   ​​​R​​eboot the computer and the OS installer should pop up. For any issues refer to our helpful guide on ​​​￼​​what to do if your operating system will not install on your SSD​​​.​ 
                    <br><br>
                    Congratulations, you've now built your own PC!
